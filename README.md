# Neural Nets from Scratch - Python Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Neural Nets from Scratch project! This project follows the book "Neural Nets from Scratch" by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukieła. It aims to implement neural networks from the ground up using Python, without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. This approach provides a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of neural networks.
